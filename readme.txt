 Setup a Claim listing screen with User Management.

1. Create user API
2. Authenticate user and generate JWT token
3. Reset password API
4. All data retrieval API requests are to be validated for token and access
4. List user API (only for user role admin)
5. List claims (claims data spreadsheet attached. For all users).  List claims should allow the API parameters for page and limit.

The page should control which page of data is retrieved and the limit should control how many claims are retrieved per page.
To create a User, the required fields are First name, Last name, Email, and Role. Address, City, and Pincode can be optional.

You are required to provide the DB scripts to create the table/collections and also need to populate the static data if any.
API request/response should be JSON

Deliverables:  Code, setup instructions, and db scripts

We will be testing the API using Postman
